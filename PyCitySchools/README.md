Inside the folder labeled "PyCitySchools", you will find my code inside my jupyter notebook also titled "PyCitySchools".

I may have printed some cells along the way while I was checking my work, but the results should be accurate to the starter code they gave us.

I've put my written analysis on the very LAST (bottom) cell as a comment, but I will also add it to this ReadMe for convenience:

Written Analysis:
According to the data: the schools with the most total budget were District schools. However, the better averages for math & reading scores and the better passing score for math and reading overall are Charter schools.

Due to this, the top 5 highest performing schools based on the overall passing % for both math and reading were all Charter Schools, while the top 5 bottom performing schools were all District Schools. The data also states that the size of the school matters as well, as the schools with 2,000 to 5,000 students had poorer scores overall than schools with less than 1,000 students or have anywhere between 1,000 to 2,000 students.

We can infer 2 conclusions from these observations:
1.) The higher the budget does not necessarily mean that there will be better performance in an institution.
2.) Having an institution that accommodates a smaller population (one that doesnâ€™t overfill their classrooms perhaps), show better performance overall than institutions who have to cater to a larger student body.
